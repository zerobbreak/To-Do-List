## Project Description

Create a web-based Todo List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application will allow users to manage their tasks, organize them into projects, and persistently store data using the Web Storage API (localStorage). The application will dynamically generate and manage todo items, including their properties such as title, description, due date, and priority. Users will be able to create, view, edit, and delete todos and projects.

## Project Requirements

1. **Todo Item Properties**:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Due Date
    - Priority
    - Optional: Notes
    - Optional: Checklist
2. **Project Management**:
    - Users can create new projects.
    - Todos are initially added to a default project.
    - Users can assign todos to specific projects.
3. **Modular Code**:
    - Separate application logic from DOM-related functionality.
    - Use separate modules for managing todos, projects, and UI interactions.
4. **User Interface**:
    - View all projects.
    - View todos within each project (display title and due date).
    - Differentiate todo items based on priority (e.g., use color-coding).
    - Expand a single todo to view and edit its details.
    - Delete a todo.
5. **External Libraries**:
    - Consider using the `date-fns` library for date and time formatting and manipulation.
6. **Persistence**:
    - Implement data persistence using `localStorage`.
    - Create functions to save and retrieve projects and todos from `localStorage`.
    - Handle cases where data may not exist in `localStorage` gracefully.

## Project Inspiration

For inspiration, refer to popular todo apps like Todoist, Things, and [any.do](http://any.do/) to observe their user interface and features.

## Getting Started

- Use a development environment with a web server to test your application locally.
- Set up Webpack and consider using npm to manage external libraries.
- Implement the basic structure of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- Start with creating and managing todos and gradually add project-related functionality.
- Test your app thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.

## Project Completion

- Ensure the application works smoothly, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete todos and projects.
- Implement data persistence using `localStorage` so that todos and projects are retained after a page refresh.
- Polish the user interface and ensure it is responsive and user-friendly.

## Additional Notes

- Document your code and provide clear comments for better code readability.
- Regularly test the application during development to catch and fix any issues.
- Consider adding error handling for scenarios like missing data in `localStorage`.
- Make sure your app is visually appealing and intuitive for users to navigate.

Good luck with your Todo List Web App project!
